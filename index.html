<h2>Part #1: Social Issue Loopy Model </h2>
<p>Figure 1: This figure shows a loopy model about our social issue, global warming/climate change, and our animation video is intended to make a difference on one of its main causes, natural disasters. In our animation video, we focused on one of the numerous natural disasters, forest fires. We created this animation video to inform the audience about the devastating effects of these natural disasters, as well as to persuade the audience to make a change, posibly by helping to restore the damaged forests by planting trees or helping natural disaster victims restore their lives back to a sense of normality, possibly by helping in the restoration of their home. We inform the audience by creating the animation video to illustrate the effects of natural disasters and we persuade the audience to make a change by showing the protagonist in our animation rebuilding his burnt house and his beloved forest by planting new trees.</p>

        <h2>Part #2: Storyboard (Images & Explanation)</h2>
        <p>Figure 2: This figure shows the general storyboard for our animation video and the main events that occur within. Descriptions of each image are included below.
      <ul>
        <li>Image 1: The story begins. A group of campers arrive at an open area in the forest and build a campfire to rest and warm up in the cold night.</li>
        <li>Image 2: The story escalates. The group of campers wake up in the middle of the night to see their unattended campfire now spreading, catching on the trees and dry grass. They run away, leaving everything behind as their campfire goes out of control and starts burning down the forest.</li>
        <li>Image 3: The story climaxes. The protagonist, the owner of the house in the background and a skilled hiker and botanist, returns from a trip, only to find the forest and his home burned to the ground, the last traces of smoke rising into the sky.</li>
        <li>Image 4: The story’s “falling action”, things are calming down. The protagonist starts planting trees to restore the forest. His house can also be seen in the background, almost completely rebuilt. The moon and sun show the protagonist working day and night.</li>
        <li>Image 5: The story ends/repeats. The forest and the protagonist’s house has been restored and the hiker is leaving on another trip. The story loops and returns to the first scene once again.</li>
      </ul>

   <h2>Part #3: Contribution, Characters, Set, & Mechanical Designs</h2>
  <p>My contribution: I worked on the majority of the background animation set for the video, as well as the majority of the frames that we have for our video. I created the trees, clouds, night sky, and grass for the background set. Along with this, I also helped with the frames we took for the video; I was either taking the frame after the set had been moved or I was moving the characters and the set for the next frame. In addition, I modified the AdaFruit code for the lighting we needed for the 2 fires in our animation, the campfire that the camper creates and the forest fire. I modified this code to have more accurate colors and brightness, as well as changing the way that the colors shift from one another at the click of a button.<br></br>
  Figure 3 (The Set): The figure below is a behind-the-scenes picture of our animation background/set in progress. It is made out of a cardboard box and is elevated by a green, styrofoam-like semicircle (Not shown in figure). There are 2D and 3D trees, as well as clouds made from cotton, grass-like paper for the ground, different shades of dark blue construction paper to create the night sky, and finally, black construction paper taped to the box to create a darker environment to emphasize the fact that a forest fire can occur in the span of a single night and have devastating effects regardless. While the proper and final lighting we used cannot be seen in this figure, our first attempt at the lighting for the campfire with the circuit light is shown. The yellow light comes from a hole in the "ceiling" of the cardboard box, where the circular circuit is fitted in with the proper code. However, using the non-programmble light, different shades and brightnesses of yellow, orange, and red were used to show the light of the campfire or the forest fire.<br></br>
  Figure 4 (Characters): Our main characters were the campers, which we decided to shorten to one lone camper, and the protagonist. The camper symbolizes the audience, specifically those interested in hiking and camping. The camper's simple mistake of leaving a campfire unattended is shown in the animation video to grow into a large problem and dilemma for the protagonist. The role of the camper is to show the audience what NOT to do while camping. On the other hand, the protagonist plays the role of the victim, specifically a natural disaster victim. However, his perseverance and skills allow him to restore both his house and the forest, persuading the audience to make a change in the world by helping victims of natural disasters who may have lost everything.<br></br>
  Figure 5 (Mechanical Design): In our animation video, the mechanical designs included the circuit light and the non-programmable light, as well as the Dragonframe program and the tools that came with it, such as the control pad. In this figure, all of these elements are shown. The different lighting elements helped create the light effect from the fires, while the Dragonframe program and tools helped create our individual frames of animation into a full video.</p>

  <h2>Part #4: Technology Usage</h2>
      <p>Figure 6: This figure shows the full javascript code for the campfire lighting, using the website called "AdaFruit" with the circuit light. A detailed explanation of the code is provided below.<br></br>
Explanation of JavaScript Code: The first line sets the way the lighting will switch between the colors, which happens at the click of Button A. The following lines are the code for the campfire lighting. First, in all values of the "frame" variable, which was customized for our specific use, the brightness is set to the highest value possible, 255. This brightness is set in each frame variable because initially, the brightness would increase to show the fire growing. However, this did not work, thus our group decided to keep the brightness the same using the circuit light. Next, the "frame" variable is set at +1, and an "if" statement follows. The "if" statement states that when the "frame" variable has a value of 1, the light will show specific yellow light in the light ring, which is the repetition of yellow and black. The black color simply indicates that the specific light is not shining a yellow light and is off. The "if" statement continues with 2 "else" conditions, at a "frame" variable value of 2 or 3. At "frame" variable value 2, the process of the yellow lights is repeated, except with more of the individual lights now included and emitting a orange light. At "frame" variable value 3, the same process occurs again, except now, all lights are on and emitting a red light. This is the code for the lighting of our campfire.</p>

  <h2>Part #5: Final Animation Video</h2>
      <p>This is our final animation video of our social issue, global warming/climate change, and one of its' main causes, natural disasters, specifically, forest fires. Enjoy!<br></br></p>
