	<h2> Social Issue Loopy Model </h2>
		<p>Our animation video is intended to make a difference on our social issue, global warming/climate change, and its main cause, natural disasters. In our animation video, we focused on one of the numerous natural disasters, forest fires. We created this animation video to inform the audience about the devastating effects of these natural disasters, as well as to persuade the audience to make a change, which was to help restore the damaged forests by planting trees or helping natural disaster victims restore their lives to a sense of normality, possibly by helping in the restoration of their home. We inform the audience by creating the animation video to illustrate the effects of natural disasters and we persuade the audience to make a change by showing the protagonist in our animation rebuilding his burnt house and his beloved forest by planting new trees.</p>
