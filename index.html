<h2>Part #1: Social Issue Loopy Model </h2>
<p>Figure 1: This figure shows a loopy model about our social issue, global warming/climate change, andn our animation video is intended to make a difference on one of its main causes, natural disasters. In our animation video, we focused on one of the numerous natural disasters, forest fires. We created this animation video to inform the audience about the devastating effects of these natural disasters, as well as to persuade the audience to make a change, which was to help restore the damaged forests by planting trees or helping natural disaster victims restore their lives to a sense of normality, possibly by helping in the restoration of their home. We inform the audience by creating the animation video to illustrate the effects of natural disasters and we persuade the audience to make a change by showing the protagonist in our animation rebuilding his burnt house and his beloved forest by planting new trees.</p>

        <h2>Part #2: Storyboard (Images & Explanation)</h2>
        <p>Figure 2: This figure shows the general storyboard for our animation video and the main events that occur within. Descriptions of each image are included below.
      <ul>
        <li>Image 1: The story begins. A group of campers arrive at an open area in the forest and build a campfire to rest and warm up in the cold night.</li>
        <li>Image 2: The story escalates. The group of campers wake up in the middle of the night to see their unattended campfire now spreading, catching on the trees and dry grass. They run away, leaving everything behind as their campfire goes out of control and starts burning down the forest.</li>
        <li>Image 3: The story escalates to the climax. The protagonist, the owner of the house in the background and a skilled hiker and botanist, returns from a trip, only to find the forest and his home burned to the ground, the last traces of smoke rising into the sky.</li>
        <li>Image 4: The story’s “falling action”, things are calming dowm. The protagonist starts planting trees to restore the forest. His house can also be seen in the background, almost completely rebuilt. The moon and sun show the protagonist working day and night.</li>
        <li>Image 5: The story ends/repeats. The forest and the protagonist’s house has been restored and the hiker is leaving on another trip. The story loops and returns to the first scene once again.</li>
      </ul>
